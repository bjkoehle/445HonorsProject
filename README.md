# How to use code:
This project was built using 4 different technologies: HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and WCF service. These files are then hosted in a webserver and served as a static website with the files found in the folder all placed at the web-root folder.
Everything should just work if the files are places and served like this. There is no need to build anything.
